# NodeApp - Containerized JavaScript Backend with CI/CD

A production-ready Node.js web application demonstrating containerization, automated testing, and continuous integration/deployment practices using Docker and Jenkins for scalable backend development.

## Technologies Used
- **Backend**: Node.js, JavaScript, Express.js
- **Containerization**: Docker, Dockerfile optimization
- **CI/CD**: Jenkins, Automated pipelines
- **Testing**: Unit testing, Test automation
- **DevOps**: Container orchestration, Build automation

## Key Features & Results
- **Containerized Deployment**: Docker-based application packaging for consistent environments
- **Automated CI/CD**: Jenkins pipeline for continuous integration and deployment
- **Production-Ready**: Optimized build process with automated testing and validation
- **Scalable Architecture**: Container-based deployment suitable for microservices

## Technical Implementation

### Backend Architecture
- **Node.js Application**: Lightweight web server with Express framework
- **Modular Design**: Clean separation of concerns for maintainable code
- **Automated Testing**: Unit test suite with continuous validation

### DevOps Pipeline
- **Dockerization**: Multi-stage Docker builds for optimized container images
- **Jenkins Integration**: Automated build, test, and deployment pipeline
- **Quality Gates**: Automated testing and code validation in CI pipeline

### Infrastructure as Code
- **Container Configuration**: Dockerfile with best practices for production deployment
- **Pipeline as Code**: Jenkinsfile defining automated CI/CD workflows
- **Environment Consistency**: Containerized runtime ensuring dev-prod parity

## Quick Start

### Local Development
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run the application
npm start

# Run tests
npm test
```

### Docker Deployment
```bash
# Build container image
docker build -t nodeapp .

# Run containerized application
docker run -p 3000:3000 nodeapp
```

### CI/CD Pipeline
The Jenkins pipeline automatically:
1. Pulls source code from repository
2. Builds Docker container image
3. Runs automated test suite
4. Deploys to target environment

## DevOps Capabilities
- **Container Orchestration**: Ready for Kubernetes deployment
- **Automated Testing**: Continuous validation in CI pipeline
- **Build Optimization**: Efficient Docker layers and caching
- **Deployment Automation**: Zero-downtime deployment strategies

This project demonstrates proficiency in modern backend development, containerization, CI/CD automation, and DevOps practices essential for scalable web application deployment.
